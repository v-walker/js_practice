const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// 1. Hello World
// Make an express program that will display "Hello, world!" at the root URL: /

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello, World!');
});

// 2. Routes
// Add to your program the following pages:
// "Meow" at the URL /cats "Woof" at the URL /dogs "Living together" at the URL /cats_and_dogs

app.get('/cats', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Meow');
});

app.get('/dogs', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Woof');
});

app.get('/cats_and_dogs', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Living together');
});

// 3. Route Parameters
// Adding to the same program, say a greeting to the user, given that the user's name is encoded inside the URL. For example, if you go to the URL
    // /greet/Kennedy it should say "Hello, Kennedy!"
    // /greet/Jamison it should say "Hello, Jamison!"
    // /greet/Manny it should say "Hello, Manny!"
    // etc..

app.get('/greet/', (req, res) => {
    let name = req.params.name;
    res.send(`Hello, ${name}!`)
})

// 4. Query Parameters: Tell the year you were born
// Adding to the same program, display the year you were born when you report your age in a query parameter. For example, when you go to the URL:
    // /year?age=32 it will display You were born in 1985.

app.get('/year', (req, res) => {
    let age = parseInt(req.query.age);
    let bornIn = 2021 - age;
    res.send(`You were born in ${bornIn}.`)
})

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`listening on port ${port}`);
});
